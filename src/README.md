## Naive Exact String Matching

Matches a Substring within a string by progressively comparing the individual characters of both
Naive as it does not attempt to make any optimizations  

## Todo
[ ] Have program accept command line arguments to accept a file to search in and the pattern from the terminal
[ ] Test for the O(n) performance of the algorithms - worst, best and averages cases.
